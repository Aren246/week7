Reflection on Full-Stack Development Challenges
This project highlighted the reality that full-stack development involves juggling multiple moving pieces, and time constraints can significantly impact problem-solving capacity. While my understanding of React concepts like component structure, state management, and routing proved solid, the backend integration presented unexpected hurdles that consumed more time than anticipated.
What I Successfully Accomplished:
Despite the challenges, I completed substantial portions of a full-stack application that demonstrated strong technical understanding:
Frontend Development:

Built a complete React application with proper component architecture
Implemented React Router for seamless navigation between pages
Created a Home component with data fetching, loading states, and auto-refresh functionality
Developed a fully functional recipe creation form with validation and state management
Applied comprehensive CSS styling with a cohesive orange and grey theme
Implemented responsive design principles for mobile compatibility
Handled error states and user feedback appropriately

Backend Architecture:

Set up an Express server with proper middleware configuration
Implemented CORS for cross-origin requests
Created RESTful API endpoints for GET and POST operations
Configured JSON parsing and error handling
Established database connection logic and query structure
Set up development workflow with auto-restart functionality

Database and Infrastructure:

Created and configured a Supabase PostgreSQL database
Designed proper table schema with appropriate data types
Populated database with sample data for testing
Understood connection string configuration and SSL requirements

Development Workflow:

Organized project structure with clear separation of concerns
Implemented version control with Git
Created monorepo structure for coordinated development
Successfully ran both frontend and backend in development mode

The frontend development flowed relatively smoothly. Building reusable components, implementing React Router, managing form state, and creating responsive CSS felt manageable and logical. The concepts clicked, and I could visualize how each piece connected to create the user experience.
However, the backend proved more challenging than expected. While I understood the Express server setup and API endpoint design conceptually, the practical implementation revealed knowledge gaps. Database connection configuration, particularly with Supabase's specific requirements around SSL settings and connection strings, became a significant roadblock. What should have been straightforward setup turned into extended debugging sessions.Time constraints meant I couldn't fully troubleshoot the deployment pipeline.  The urgency to complete the project made it difficult to work through these systematically.
